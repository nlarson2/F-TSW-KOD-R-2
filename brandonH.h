// =================== Gordon, please read ===================
// My files are both the MainMenu and Gamestate, both the .h files and .cpp files for a total of 4 files.
// Additionally I merged together the asteroids framework and the lab1 framework to create the main.cpp file
// to allow for testing and merging of our groups code.
//
// I could move the code over to my .cpp and .h files but I would prefer this method as I do not want to take
// too much time moving code around as im hard at work on this game. Please take a look at our commit history
// for further details.
